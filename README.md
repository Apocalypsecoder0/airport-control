The Unknow Name airline system has hired you to develop a database system
to keep track of airline reservations and flights.

Each flight requires the following information:
Flight Number (unique key), Departure and Arrival City, Date of Flight,
Departure and Arrival Time, Number of Seats, Number of Seats Booked
and an array of passengers on the flight stored by passenger ID.

Each reservation requires the following information:
Reservation ID (unique key), Passenger ID, Flight Number, Cost

Each passenger requires the following information:
Passenger ID (unique key), First Name, Last Name, Address, City

1)	Create structures for each of the above files and read the
information from three separate data files.

2)	The airline also wants the following set up:
a)	An input screen to add new flights (does not add passengers).
b)	An input screen to add new passengers (does not add flights).
c)	An input screen to add reservations (used to add passengers to flights).
d)	An output screen to show all current flights, sorted by departure time.
e)	An output screen to show all the passengers on a selected flight
 sorted by last name.
f)	Add a save option to store the file.

Some other notes:
- Passengers and flights must already be in the system in order
to be added to a reservation.

	- Use the unique ID's so you do not repeat data in the files.*/
